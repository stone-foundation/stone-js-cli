The official CLI tool for building, running, and managing Stone.js applications.

---

## Overview

**Stone CLI** is the primary interface for creating and managing Stone.js projects.  
It provides a powerful set of built-in commands to bootstrap apps, serve them locally, build for production, and more.

Whether you're developing a backend microservice, a frontend SPA, a fullstack SSR app, or a CLI tool powered by Stone.js, the CLI helps you get started quickly and stay productive.

## Key Features

- Create and scaffold new Stone.js apps interactively
- Run development servers with hot reload
- Build production bundles and preview them
- Export third-party toolchain configs (e.g., Rollup, Vite)
- Type checking and cache clearing
- Discover and run custom commands defined in your app or installed libraries

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @stone-js/cli
```

You can also use it locally via `npx`:

```bash
npx stone
```

Once installed, try:

```bash
stone --help
```
